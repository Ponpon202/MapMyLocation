     Hermes is an attempt to provide a sense of security to all the travelers of all over the world and especially the women who use the public transport to commute to their work place and back home.
	 
	The application consists of two main features:
	<ul>
	<li>TrackMe</li>
	<li>LiveTrack</li>
	</ul>

<h3>TrackMe</h3>
TrackMe enables your friends and family to locate you easily. They just need to send you a SMS containing a secret code ("hermes" by default). Upon receipt of this SMS, the application automatically sends a SMS reply to the sender containing the Google Maps link of your location.

<h3>LiveTrack</h3>
LiveTrack enables you to automatically publish your location on Facebook at regular intervals tagged ONLY to your friends and families. You just need to connect to Facebook and specify which specific 
friends in your friend list will be able to see the posted location on your timeline.
